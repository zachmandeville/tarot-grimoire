.Dt THE-FOOL 7 
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm The-Fool 
.Sh SYNOPSIS
The fool sets out for an adventure.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
begins the tarot and is filled  with all the energy of the world, though without the knowledge
of being filled.  Instead, the energy shows itself as innocence and pure joy and the inarguable want for adventure. He stands
with bindle in one hand, walking stick in the other, heading to the right on shaky ground
and towards a destination we cannot see.  An animal companion pushes him on from behind, 
urging him forward.
.Sh IN A READING
Joy, innocence, lightness,  energy without known purpose, travel.  If not physical travel, then the 
travelling of your heart when it beats so happy right out of your chest.
.Sh BUT ALSO
Brashness, acting without thinking, naivete. Enthusiasm without rational balance.
