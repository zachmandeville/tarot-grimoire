# tarot-grimoire

This is an aspirational repo, and it may be a while before code is actually put in.
The intent is to build a command line grimoire to hold tarot interpretations that come from daily draws.  It also would hold documentation around all the cards in the tarot.  this documentation could be called using the `man` command.
